| **20.10.22** | Sprint length  | The sprint length of one week is too short for us (Developer). Our proposal is to change to a two-week iteration, so we have more flexibility to work on our tasks. This change was recorded in the [project-decisions](project-decisions.md) protocol of 26.10.2022                                                                 |
| **30.10.22** | Issue planning | We have started to create tickets for each individual CRUD operation. However, from our point of view, this is not useful, as the operation alone does not contain all the associated tasks. Instead, we want to create tickets on a component basis, which includes all related steps (tests, implementation, documentation, etc.). |
| **05.11.22** | Figma          | We ran into problem because why designed more features in Figma than agreed in the sprint planning. Is the story now finished or not? Is it required or stretch? We decided to only put in Figma what we discussed and use a different board for ideas that pop up.                                                                  |
| **06.12.22** | Sprint Review  | We had some spillover stories lately and had problems in the review because of that. Do we show it in the next review again? Hard to give feedback like this. Agreed to not show it in the review and just mention that it is a spillover story that will be shown in the next review.                                               |
