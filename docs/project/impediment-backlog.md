| **20.10.22** | Sprint length  | The sprint length of one week is too short for us (Developer). Our proposal is to change to a two-week iteration, so we have more flexibility to work on our tasks. This change was recorded in the [project-decisions](project-decisions.md) protocol of 26.10.2022                                                                 |
| **30.10.22** | Issue planning | We have started to create tickets for each individual CRUD operation. However, from our point of view, this is not useful, as the operation alone does not contain all the associated tasks. Instead, we want to create tickets on a component basis, which includes all related steps (tests, implementation, documentation, etc.). |
