# Project Setup

In this project the framework scrum is applied. This document contains the way Scrum is implemented for this project.

### Sprint Planning

* **Attendees**: Scrum Team, Project Coach
* **Goal**: Initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.

* **Outcome**: Sprint Backlog

### Sprint Review

* **Attendees**: Scrum Team, Project Coach
* **Goal**: Inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
* **Procedure**: The Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment.

### Sprint Retrospective

* **Goal**: Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
* **Procedure**: The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

## Artefacts

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

### Impediment Backlog

The impediment backlog is kept in the following document: [project-decisions](project-decisions.md)
