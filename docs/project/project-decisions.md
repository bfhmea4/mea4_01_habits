# Project decisions

This document keeps track of important decisions about this project

## List of decisions

- Use Kotlin & Spring Boot instead of Go & the PocketBase framework
- Use Flyway as a database migration tool
- Use Next.js 12 instead of 13 for now
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Write controllers and accept some boilerplate code instead of using Spring Data
  - More flexibility by doing that
  - Learn one thing at a time. Too much magic for us now.
