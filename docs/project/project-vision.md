# Vision

Our vision for our habit tracking app is to empower users to achieve their goals and improve their lives
through consistent, intentional action. We believe in the power of customization and have designed our app
to be highly customizable and tailored to individual needs. Our app will be reliable, responsive, and
secure, utilizing the latest technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. In addition to tracking
existing habits, we also focus on helping users develop new, positive habits that will improve their
lives. We understand that building new habits can be challenging, which is why we have included features
such as customizable reminders, progress tracking, and goal setting to help users stay on track and
motivated. We are committed to continuous improvement through open-source collaboration and user feedback
and believe that by focusing on the development of healthy habits, our users will be able to make lasting,
positive changes in their lives and reach their full potential.

## Atomic Habits

Our app is loosely based on the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. The book outlines the importance of
building good habits and breaking bad habits, and provides a framework for doing so.

- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. --> Dashboard
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. --> Gamification (visibility of progress)
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. --> Interface as simple as possible, the least amount of clicks to log a habit
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. --> The whole idea of Habit tracking itself
