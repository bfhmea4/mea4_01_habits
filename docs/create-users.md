# Create users

There are two types of users:
- **Admin user**: can login in to the admin interface (PocketBase) and create *normal users* for the frontend
- **Normal user**: can login in to the frontend, end-user of the application

## Admin users

### Initial admin user

After the initial start of the backend (PocketBase), you must create an initial admin user as follow:

- go to the Backend Admin Interface: [http://localhost:8090/_/](http://localhost:8090/_/) and create a new user with email and password
