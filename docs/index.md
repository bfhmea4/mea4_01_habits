# Documentations / Guides
This is the official documentation and guides website of the system environment of **Habits**.
All documentation is open-source and can be edited by the community *(In case you have an enhancement or find a bug)*.

Our habit tracking app is built with Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications, and uses the utility-first CSS framework tailwind CSS for fast-loading and customizable designs. The frontend is written in TypeScript and we use Yarn as our package manager.

At the core of our app is a custom habit tracking system built with React and Axios. This system allows users to create and manage their habits, and log their daily activities. The app also provides a variety of filters and views to help users track their progress and stay motivated.

In addition to the habit tracking system, the app includes a journaling feature built with React and a custom backend API. This API is built using Spring Boot and Kotlin, and uses PostgreSQL as the database. This allows us to provide a powerful and scalable backend for our app, ensuring that it can handle a large number of users and data.

In a nutshell, our habit tracking app is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use, providing users with the tools they need to build and maintain healthy habits.

# Vision

Our vision for our habit tracking app is to empower users to achieve their goals and improve their lives through consistent, intentional action. We believe in the power of customization and have designed our app to be highly customizable and tailored to individual needs. Our app will be reliable, responsive, and secure, utilizing the latest technologies to ensure a seamless user experience. In addition to tracking existing habits, we also focus on helping users develop new, positive habits that will improve their lives. We understand that building new habits can be challenging, which is why we have included features such as customizable reminders, progress tracking, and goal setting to help users stay on track and motivated. We are committed to continuous improvement through open-source collaboration and user feedback and believe that by focusing on the development of healthy habits, our users will be able to make lasting, positive changes in their lives and reach their full potential.
