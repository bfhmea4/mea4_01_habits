# Documentations / Guides
This is the official documentation and guides website of the system environment of **Habits**.
All documentation is open-source and can be edited by the community *(In case you have an enhancement or find a bug)*.

Our habit tracking app is built with Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications, and uses the utility-first CSS framework tailwind CSS for fast-loading and customizable designs. The frontend is written in TypeScript and we use Yarn as our package manager.

At the core of our app is a custom habit tracking system built with React and Axios. This system allows users to create and manage their habits, and log their daily activities. The app also provides a variety of filters and views to help users track their progress and stay motivated.

In addition to the habit tracking system, the app includes a journaling feature built with React and a custom backend API. This API is built using Spring Boot and Kotlin, and uses PostgreSQL as the database. This allows us to provide a powerful and scalable backend for our app, ensuring that it can handle a large number of users and data.

In a nutshell, our habit tracking app is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use, providing users with the tools they need to build and maintain healthy habits.
