# Frontend

Our habit tracking web app is built with Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications, and uses the utility-first CSS framework tailwind CSS to create fast-loading, responsive, and customizable designs. The frontend of our app is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, and we use Yarn as our package manager to ensure that our app has all the necessary components and resources it needs to run smoothly and efficiently.

At the core of our app is a custom-built habit tracking system that allows users to log and track their daily activities and habits. This system is built using a combination of React components and Redux for managing application state. Users can create and manage their habits, and log their activities for each habit on a daily basis. The app also provides a variety of filters and views to help users track their progress and stay motivated.

Additionally, the app includes a journaling feature that allows users to reflect on their progress and goals, and to share their thoughts and experiences with other users. This feature is built using a combination of React components and a custom-built backend API for managing user data and interactions. Overall, our habit tracking app is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to use, providing users with the tools they need to build and maintain healthy habits.
